## Fair Play & Accurate Tracking

**XPulse is designed to track real productivity, not gaming the system:**

✅ **Only your active tab counts** — background tabs don't earn points  
✅ **You must be actually using the browser** — minimized windows don't count  
✅ **Idle detection** — if you step away for 2+ minutes, the timer pauses  
✅ **Smart limits** — prevents earning too many points too quickly  
✅ **Points can't go negative** — you stop at 0 points minimum  
✅ **Secure tracking** — special browser pages (like settings) are ignored

These features ensure your stats truly reflect your productivity habits!

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

**These are NOT security issues, but expected behavior:**

- **Tab tracking is visible** — XPulse needs to see your active tab to track time
- **Local storage can be viewed** — Anyone with access to your computer can view Chrome extension storage
- **No encryption** — Stats are stored in plain text locally (they're not sensitive)
- **No password protection** — Anyone using your browser can see your stats

## 🛡️ Permissions Explained

XPulse requests these permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed | What It Does |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `tabs` | Track active tab | Knows which website you're viewing |
| `storage` | Save your progress | Stores XP, level, streaks locally |
| `alarms` | Check time every minute | Wakes up the extension to calculate points |
| `idle` | Detect when you're away | Pauses tracking when you're not actively browsing |
| `activeTab` | Monitor tab activity | Sees the URL of your current tab |

**No other permissions are requested or used.**
